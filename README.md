## Installation

Read the [installation guide](https://gitlab.squiz.net/boilerplate/webpack-boilerplate/wikis/Installation)

## Environment

This boilerplate is locked to a specific Node version to help with the experience when multiple developers need to contribute. It's strongly recommended to use `nvm` for your Node version control.

When loading up the project, use `nvm use` before installing packages to switch to the supported Node version.
